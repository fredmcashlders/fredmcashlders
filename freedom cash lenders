When life happens, taking out a personal loan may be necessary to stay afloat financially. If your credit score is in good shape and you earn enough income to afford the loan payments, you could get back on track sooner than later. But if money’s tight, managing a personal loan can be challenging and have severe consequences for your finances.
Still, it’s possible to get a good deal on a personal loan with a low income by exploring your options. The payments may still stretch your budget thin, but the borrowing costs could be more affordable if you secure a personal loan with competitive terms.
